The hashmap is faster at printing than the treemap, but it is quicker to load into the treemap than the hashmap.
I think it is quicker to print the hashmap because it doesnt have to sort the file before printing like a treemap.

The Treeset was faster than the Hashset. However, I think that the hashset should be faster than the tree set because it doesnt have to sort anything

For the last part the hashmap was quicker than the treemap, mainly because it only has to run the calculations without and sorting.
